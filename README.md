# A Blank Project

This blank project conforms to [Clarinet-compliant](https://docs.hiro.so/clarinet/how-to-guides/how-to-create-new-project) project structure. 

## Build your Contract

You can start your journey by reviewing the project structure, particularly the [Clarinet.toml](/examples/blank-project/Clarinet.toml). 

+ Start by [adding a new contract](https://docs.hiro.so/clarinet/how-to-guides/how-to-add-contract)
+ Navigate to the `/contracts` folder to review or iterate your contract's business logic
+ Navigate to `/tests` to build the test harness

> **NOTE**: To use this example with Clarinet inside [Hiro Platform](https://platform.hiro.so), you can open the terminal session inside VS code by navigating to File -> View -> Terminal.


## Test your Contract

+ You can manually test your your contracts in the [Clarinet console](https://docs.hiro.so/clarinet/how-to-guides/how-to-test-contract#load-contracts-in-a-console).
+ You can programmatically test your contracts with [unit tests](https://docs.hiro.so/clarinet/how-to-guides/how-to-test-contract).
